TechDegree Project 2
Pagination and filtering 
A description of the project in your own words

This project used DOM scripting to apply  pagination and filtering to a given list , in this case students. 

The Extra credit features added were


Add search component
Dynamically create and append a search bar. Avoid making any changes in the index.html file. You can reference the examples/example-exceeds.html file, lines 16-19, to see an example of the markup you'll create.
Add functionality to the search component
When the "Search" button is clicked, the list is filtered by student name for those that include the search value. For example, if the name Phillip is typed into the box, list all items with a name that includes Phillip. If the letter S is typed in, all items with an S in the name will show.

Pro Tip: To improve the functionality and add to the user experience, consider adding a keyup event listener to the search input so that the list filters in real time as the user types. This would be in addition to making the search button clickable since pasting text into the search bar might not trigger the keyup event. (THIS WAS ALSO COMPLETED)

Paginate search results
Display pagination links based on how many search results are returned. For example: if 10 or fewer results are returned, 0 or 1 pagination links are displayed. If 22 search results are returned, 3 pagination links are displayed.

Pro Tip: To paginate the search results, try storing the search results in an array that can act as a list, on which you can call your functions to show a page and append pagination links.(THIS ADVICE WAS USED)

Handle no results returned
If no matches are found by the search, include a message in the HTML to tell the user there are no matches. (MESSAGE 'Sorry no ,matches found added to page')
